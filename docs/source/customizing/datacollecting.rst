Datacollecting
==============

BlockBall uses `https://bstats.org <https://bstats.org>`__ to collect anonymous data from your server.
This is being used in order to get feedback if BlockBall is worth being continued and steady improved.

You are allowed to disable metrics in the config.yml, however for supporting BlockBall set it to true.
Also, enabling metrics does not have an impact on your server performance at all.

**config.yml**
::
    metrics: true
