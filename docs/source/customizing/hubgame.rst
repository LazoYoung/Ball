Creating a HubGame
==================

Let's start of creating our first BlockBallGame. This will be the guide for creating a game using the default gamemode called HubGame.

1. Background Knowledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A HubGame is basically a soccer arena which is often found in **hub or lobby worlds**. Players can directly join the game by entering the
forcefield around of the arena and play with others. Joining and leaving the game is possible at any time and the match score gets only
reset after reaching a certain amount of goals.

It is the **default gamemode** when you are creating a **new arena** as it only needs minimized configuration to work properly.
