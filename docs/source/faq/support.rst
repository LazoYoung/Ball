Can you support Minecraft 1.7.x or below?
=========================================

Sorry, it is not possible to support Minecraft 1.7.x or below as PetBlocks relies on Armorstands which
where added in Minecraft 1.8.0. If you are using a plugin to support multiple minecraft versions make sure
you do not use PetBlocks on a 1.7.x server.
