The easiest thing is to rate the plugin on spigotmc.org, planetminecraft.com or github.com. It encourages me to continue supporting BlockBall. :)

Todo?

New feature idea? Bug report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All features the plugin is likely to receive in the future can be viewed at the `issues section of BlockBall <https://github.com/Shynixn/BlockBall/issues>`__.

The easiest option to suggest new features or report bugs is to submit a new issue there. However, I do also take reports from the spigot comment section or
private messages on spigot.

Developer? How can I customize BlockBall?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to customize BlockBall to your own needs,  consider using the Developer Api.

You can also add new features by simply forking the plugin on github:

* Press Fork on github
* git clone the repository to your local pc
* Create a lib folder at the same folder level as docs and blockball-api
* Put the all spigot libraries from spigot-1.8 - spigot-1.12 into it.
* Use maven to compile the plugin.

When you are finished, you can also submit a pull request to merge your feature into the official repository.
